    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "__WHY ?__\n",
    "1. It ensures effective utilization of computer system resources.\n",
    "2. Multithreaded applications are more responsive.\n",
    "3. It shares resources and its state with sub-threads (child) which makes it more economical.\n",
    "4. It makes the multiprocessor architecture more effective due to similarity.\n",
    "5. It saves time by executing multiple threads at the same time.\n",
    "6. The system does not require too much memory to store multiple threads.\n",

    "In Python, the \"threading\" module is used to handle threads. This module provides a high-level API for creating and managing threads in Python. The threading module allows a program to create multiple threads and start them in parallel. It provides various methods and functions for controlling the execution of threads, including starting, stopping, and suspending threads.\n",
    "1. __activeCount():__ This function returns the number of thread objects that are currently alive. A thread object is considered alive from the moment it is started until the moment it terminates.\n",
    "2. __currentThread():__ This function returns a reference to the current thread object. The current thread is the thread from which this function is called.\n",
    "3. __enumerate():__ This function returns a list of all thread objects that are currently alive. The list includes daemonic threads, dummy thread objects created by current_thread(), and the main thread."

    "2. __run() :__ A run() method is used to define a thread's activity and can be overridden by a class that extends the threads class.\n",
    "3. __join() :__ A join() method is used to block the execution of another code until the thread terminates.\n",
    "4. __is_alive() :__ This method returns True just before the run() method starts until just after the run() method terminates. The module function enumerate() returns a list of all alive threads."

    "1. __Race Condition :__ A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource at the same time, and the order of access or execution is not predetermined. This can lead to unpredictable and potentially incorrect behavior, as the outcome of the program depends on the order in which the threads access the resource. Race conditions can occur when threads access shared variables or data structures without proper synchronization, such as using locks or semaphores to control access.\n",
    "2. __Dead lock :__ A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need to continue running. This results in a situation where none of the threads can proceed, and the program becomes stuck. Deadlocks can occur when threads hold locks on resources while waiting for other resources, creating a \"circular wait\" situation. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, and can cause programs to become unresponsive or crash."
